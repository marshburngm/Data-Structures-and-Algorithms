Set of values that related to different pairs.
Nodes or vertices are connected via edges. 
Great for connecting real world relationships and presenting links. 
  -etc. roads, networks, relationships, etc. 
Trees, Linkedlists are a branch of graphs. 
Can be directed or undirected. 
  -Can flow multiple direcetions or have one specific way only. 
Can have weighted and unweighted (value or no value associated with the edges).  
  -Can be cyclic (common in weighted) or acyclic, vertices connected in a circular fashion or not. 
  
Great for displaying relationships.
Does NOT scale well.  
Built off other data structures.  
Likely will not have to implement your own graph.
