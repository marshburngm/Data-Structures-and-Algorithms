Creates key-value pairs for quick access.
Stores in array or list of certain size.
Hash function generates an index to store the value based off an equation.
The hash function is one way. 
Good at improving time complexity.
Unable to be ordered, however there is no index shifting.
Slow Key iteration.
Can have collisions, in which we can resolve this by using a hashtable with a linked list (separate chaining).

Hash function is generally O(1)
Insert = O(1)
Lookup = O(1)
Delete = O(1)
Search = O(1)

If a collision occurs then we have to search the supporting data structure which in turn would affect Big O.
For example, if seperate chaining is used, if something colides, lookup would be O(n).
