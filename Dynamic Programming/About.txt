Optimization technique.
Solving problems by breaking things down into subproblems so you can have a solution to that subproblem if it occurs again. 
Uses memoization which is a form of caching. 
Combines divide and conquer and memoization.

1. Can it be divided into a sub problem?
2. Does it have a recursive solution?
3. Are there repetitive subproblems?
4. Memoize the subproblems.
