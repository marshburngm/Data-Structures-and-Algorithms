Calls a function within itself.
Be careful with stack overflow.
Must have a base case and an exit case to avoidstack overflow. 
Anything that can be implemented recursively can be implemented iteratively. 
Can keep code readable and DRY but can be very taxing on memory. 
Good for trees, graphs and traversals.
1. Problem can be divided into smaller instances of the same problem.
2. Each instance of the subproblem is identical in nature.
3. The solutions of each subproblem can be combined to solve the problem at hand.
